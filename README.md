## Hi

Thanks for visiting my GitHub profile.

I'm currently in the process of migrating repositories to my
[Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/voided). Repositories which have not received
significant interaction (stars, forks) will be deleted here after migration.
Repositories deemed unsuitable for migration (for copyright/license reasons)
will remain here for now.

Future activity on this account will be limited to forks, contributions, and
maintenance of remaining repositories.
